  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) <2024> <Jailbrek>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                               Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program— to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GPL for most of our software; it is an important part of the system of free software that we are building.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in "free speech," not as in "free beer." Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To ensure that everyone has freedom, we have developed this license, which uses copyright law to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program— to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

The GPL applies to software, but it can be used for other works, too. You can apply it to any work you want, and it is not limited to software.
